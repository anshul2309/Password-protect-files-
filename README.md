# Password-protect-files-
This software lets you protect the files, by making them a zip protected with a password. This works on MacBook. 

I have made this software for macbook, just download the software, allow permissions on mac.

------------------xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-------------

<B>GO TO SYSTEM PREFERENCES >> SECURITY AND PRIVACY >> GENERAL >> CLICK THE LOCK BUTTON ON BOTTOM LEFT >> CHECK/TICK THE APPLICATION FROM MENU ON RIGHT HAND SIDE >> CLICK THE LOCK AGAIN >> RUN THE APP >> CLICK OPEN ANYWAY </B>

-----------------XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX------------- </B>



The only condition is the file should be present on the desktop of macbook for which you want to create the password for. After creating the password, you can change it's directory.

This software will create a password protected zip file and when you will enter the password, only then the zip file will open.


I used tk inter module of pyhton along with the pynput module top open terminal and type everything for you.

I used time.sleep so that if there is any delay, the software doesn't stop.



<B> CLICK ON THE DOWNLOAD BUTTON TO DOWNLOAD AFTER CLICKING ON filemenu1.py.app.zip, or just copy the code and install all pyhton libraries included and test the software. </B>
