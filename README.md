# Password-protect-files-
This software lets you protect the files, by making them a zip protected with a password. This works on MacBook. 

I have made this software for macbook, just download the software, allow permissions on mac.

The only condition is the file should be present on the desktop of macbook for which you want to create the password for. After creating the password, you can change it's directory.

This software will create a password protected zip file and when you will enter the password, only then the zip file will open.
